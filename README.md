# singlyLinkedLists

My Project designs a generic singly linked list java class to hold objects of the generic type <Anytype>

IDE used: Eclipse

My program catches the error if the choice entered is not a number or is a number less than 0 and greater than 7 and throws an exception and asks the user to enter the choice unless the choice entered is not within the range.

It also tests for the inputs entered as magazine ID whether they are numbers and throws an exception if it is not a number.
